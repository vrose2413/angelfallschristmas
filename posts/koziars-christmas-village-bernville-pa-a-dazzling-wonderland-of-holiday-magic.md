With millions of lights, meticulously crafted scenes, and an atmosphere brimming with festive cheer, Koziar’s has cemented its reputation as one of America’s premier Christmas attractions, a place where the magic of the season truly comes alive.

The story of Koziar’s Christmas Village is as heartwarming as the village itself, a testament to one man’s passion and vision. It began in 1948, not as a commercial venture, but as a personal labor of love by Arthur Koziar. What started as a modest display of lights and decorations on his family farm, intended solely for his wife and children, quickly captivated the attention of neighbors and passersby. Each year, Arthur added more lights, more animated figures, and more elaborate scenes, driven by an insatiable desire to spread holiday joy. His personal hobby soon grew beyond the confines of his property, spilling out into the surrounding fields and forests, transforming the landscape into a radiant spectacle. Word spread like wildfire, and by the mid-1950s, people were traveling from far and wide to witness what had become known as "The Christmas House." Recognizing the immense public interest, the Koziar family officially opened the gates to the public, establishing Koziar’s Christmas Village, a tradition that has continued unbroken for over seven decades, meticulously maintained and expanded by successive generations of the Koziar family.
